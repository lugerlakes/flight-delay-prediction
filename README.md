# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction

Predictive analytics project aimed at estimating the likelihood of delays in flights operated from/to Santiago Airport (SCL) in 2017. Includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, supervised model training, and robust evaluation with a reproducible approach.
