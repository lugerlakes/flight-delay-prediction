# Flight Delay Prediction

Predictive analytics project aimed at estimating the likelihood of delays in flights operated from/to Santiago Airport (SCL) in 2017. Includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, supervised model training, and robust evaluation with a reproducible approach.

## Goals
- Analyze flight delays at SCL airport during 2017
- Create meaningful synthetic features
- Train classification models to predict delays
- Evaluate performance and identify key drivers of delay
